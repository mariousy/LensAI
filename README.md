# LensAI: Visual Translation

**Instantly translate text in your photos, right from your share sheet.**

LensAI is a powerful iOS Share Extension that uses on-device machine learning to find and replace foreign-language text in your images. Built with privacy and performance in mind, all processing happens directly on your device.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **On-Device Translation**: Uses Apple's native `Translation` framework for fast, private, and offline-capable translations.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly from the Photos app (or any app that supports image sharing) via a Share Extension.
- **Smart Text Recognition**: Leverages the `Vision` framework to accurately detect text and its perspective in images.
- **Intelligent Text Grouping**: Sophisticated algorithms group related lines of text (like on a road sign) into a single, clean translation bubble.
- **Adaptive UI**: The user interface for selecting languages and saving the image is built with modern, responsive `SwiftUI`.
- **Context-Aware Rendering**: Translated text is rendered into perspective-correct bubbles that are colored based on the original image's palette for a clean, integrated look.
- **Multi-Language Support**: A dynamic language picker allows you to translate text into dozens of supported languages.
